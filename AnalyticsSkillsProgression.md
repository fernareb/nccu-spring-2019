# Analytics Skill Progression

In the spirit of *Learn and Be Curious*, we've put together a Skills Progression to help guide your learning journey. There are three tiers listed on the skills ladder below, but there are actually four tiers to the process.

## Tier-1: Mastery

This is your baseline. Every business analyst and BIE must know how to do everything in this column. 

## Tier-2: Proficiency

This is your first goal. After mastering everything in Tier-1, it's time for Tier-2. You'll need to learn everything listed in Tier-2, eventually, in your career.

## Tier-3: Expert

After you've completed Tier-1 and Tier-2, you should do **most** of these with a slight specialization depending on your interests.

When you get to Tier-3, it's time to start figuring out which pathway you'd like to focus on and make a decision between **Python** and **R. **When your skills are at Tier-3 it can be tempting to do a Software Development Engineer's (SDE) job when the engineering backlog is too full but you have to remember that your focus is on building BI Products, not Operational Tooling.****

## Tier-4: Choose Your Own Adventure

Tier-4 isn't on the skill ladder because this is where you pick your specialization.

Depending on where you're employed, each company will define these roles differently. At Amazon, and specifically on Ops Analytics, we have Business Intelligence Engineers who are responsible for being generalists across the Data Analysts, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer spectrum. There are also roles at Amazon for Data Scientists (sometimes called Research Scientists) and Data Engineers, which are specializations in those functions. 

### Job SKills Matrix by ROLE

|A	|BIE	|Business Analyst	|Data Scientist	|Data Engineer	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|Characteristics	|Loves being a generalist and enjoys never having the same day twice, has the ability to dive deep into BA/DS/DE work if need be, but may not have all the necessary skills at the start of a project. Eager to learn. Enjoys building, regardless of if it's infrastructure or algorithms. Fluent in process improvement, optimization, and cross-collaboration. Able to translate business questions and requirements into data questions or infrastructure recommendations to influence decisions across the organization.	|Loves making connections between data and the business, enjoys looking for relationships to help drive product and business decisions. Less interested in where the data comes from or how it got to them. Likes math, but not necessarily statistics. Focuses more on operational excellence, process improvement, and regression analyses than deep statistical analyses. Able to translate business questions into data questions and impact business decisions.	|Loves statistical analysis, generally has an interest in either machine learning or predictive algorithms, enjoys learning from the past to trying to predict the future. Less interested in where the data came from and how it got to them, but very interested in how behavior can influence data. Able to translate business questions into data questions and inform product decisions.	|Loves designing data models and building data pipelines, enjoys working with Engineering Teams and data customers, is able to translate business requirements and use them influence engineering decisions.	|
