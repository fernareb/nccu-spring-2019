<!-- .element style="border: 0; background: None; box-shadow: None; width:70%" --> 
</span>

<aside class="notes">And since part of my visit is convincing y'all to move to Seattle and work for Amazon...this is the view from our team room...okay but why am I here?</aside>

---

### What else have I done?
#### In the last 10 years, I've been:  <br> 
<small><span class="fragment">- Intern (many times)</span>  
<span class="fragment">- Startup Co-founder and **DreamIt** Tech Accelerator Graduate</span>  
<span class="fragment">- Tour Marketing Manager and Artist Manager</span>

<span class="fragment">- Business Intelligence Engineer and Analytics Manager at **Prime Video**</span>  
</small> 

<aside class="notes">Totally fair question, so I'm at Amazon now, but I've been working at the intersection of business and technology for over ten years. I got my first job doing this when I was 17. I was a dorm-entrepreneur. I taught myself to code. I'm the definition of a jane-of-all-trades...We're going to focus on the Analytics jobs for the next two weeks</aside>

### What is Analytics?
From wikipedia, <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics">Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data; and the process of applying those patterns towards effective decision making. In other words, analytics can be understood as the connective tissue between data and effective decision making, within an organization.</q>

#### Job Roles in Analytics

<!-- .element style="border: 0; background: None; box-shadow: None; width:70%" --> 
<small>*there's more information about these roles and their similarities/differences in the Google Drive folder.*</small>

### Why am I here?
<span class="fragment">1. There's a growing skills gap in our country</span>  
<span class="fragment">2. Getting hired can feel like a horror movie  
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26gssQGqHPDEgj4yc/source.gif"></span>  
<span class="fragment"><small>*I'm here to give you the spoilers*</small></span>

<aside class="notes">As businesses infuse more technology into their given industries, jobs are become more technical and the workforce cannot sustain the demand for talent.</aside>

#### What am I talking about?

<span class="fragment"><img src="img/headline.png">
<!-- .element style="border: 0; background: None; box-shadow: None; width:100%" --> 
</span>

<aside class="notes">What do I mean by that? I mean that, unfortunately, you're going to run into people like this. Thank you cards aren't BAD, obviously, but there is zero proof they're indicative of employee performance.</aside>

--

#### This is just as valid:

<div class="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/jdan/status/1114945440397574145"></div>

<aside class="notes">And if you've ever looked for a job, it can often feel like this is the first step they take before they decide who to hire.</aside>

--

#### So, what are you supposed to do about it? 

#### And what does data have to do with it?

<aside class="notes">That's why I'm here! Think of me as your football coach this week. I'm here to give you the playbook, go over your opponents tendencies, and teach you how you can avoid them. And we're going to do it all with data! YOU SHOULD BE AT HALF-PAST START TIME (11:30/2:30)</aside>
